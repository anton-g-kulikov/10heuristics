This repository contains a small static webpage summarizing Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics. Open `index.html` in a browser or visit the site to study them. The interface has two modes. "Read" simply lists the heuristics with their short explanations. "Study" turns each item into a flashcard: numbered covers hide the text until clicked so you can open them one by one, headings toggle their descriptions, and a "Got it!" button re-covers a card when you are done reviewing it.
